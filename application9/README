## notes

If you want to undo the step where you compile and install the GSettings schema globally, you would need to remove the schema file (`org.gtk.exampleapp.gschema.xml`) that you placed in `/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/` and then recompile the remaining schemas.

Here are the steps to undo it:

1. **Remove the Schema File:**

   Delete the schema file you installed:

   ```bash
   sudo rm /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/org.gtk.exampleapp.gschema.xml
   ```

2. **Recompile the Remaining Schemas:**

   After removing the schema, recompile the remaining schemas to update the compiled schema cache:

   ```bash
   sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
   ```

This will ensure that your system no longer uses the removed schema, and the schema cache is up to date.

## running

1. **Ensure the schema file is in the correct directory**:

   - Confirm that the file `org.gtk.exampleapp.gschema.xml` is located in the directory `/usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/` or in a local directory where you're running the app.
   - If not, copy it there with the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo cp org.gtk.exampleapp.gschema.xml /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
     ```

2. **Recompile the schemas**:
   After placing the schema file in the right location, recompile the schemas again:

   ```bash
   sudo glib-compile-schemas /usr/share/glib-2.0/schemas/
   ```

3. **Verify the installation**:

   - To verify that the schema is correctly installed, you can list the schemas:
     ```bash
     gsettings list-schemas | grep org.gtk.exampleapp
     ```
   - If `org.gtk.exampleapp` shows up in the output, it means the schema has been installed correctly.

4. **Run the application**:
   After ensuring the schema is installed, try running the application again:
   ```bash
   ./app
   ```
